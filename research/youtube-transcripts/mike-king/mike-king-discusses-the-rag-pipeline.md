so what you're seeing on the screen
right now is our pipeline for when we're
generating content for clients using
retrieval augmented generation so the
way it starts is we want to First
understand their goals and their target
audience who are they ultimately trying
to reach how are we trying to get those
people to do things then we need to
identify the content format so what are
they creating is it blog post are we
doing images for social media are we
doing imagery for blog post because
that's going to ultimately inform
everything else that we do Downstream
because we generate on a Content model
level and I'll talk about that in a
second as well then you want to identify
the right or the ideal large language
model because for your use case you may
not need chat GPC maybe you use llama
maybe you use anthropics Claud or or
whatever works for your situation and so
we'll do a lot of testing around what
we're trying to do to see what who gives
the best outputs and then we move along
from there at that point we want to
understand what are their existing
workflows and integration points so if
using Wordpress then we want to
integrate directly with WordPress we
don't want to make them use another tool
in order to publish the content and so
let's say for instance we're using air
Ops in this case they it would be a
direct publish to Wordpress like via API
or something like that in order to make
the workflow work for them then we want
to identify the right content assets to
teach the model so when we talk about
indexing everything we want to make sure
that we have a series Ser of blog posts
white papers spreadsheets in some cases
because we want to be able to pull the
data or if it's building out a knowledge
graph for them all of that would be
identified and then we index it in the
rag Pipeline and then from there we want
to generate a series of prompts so the
prompts that we generate like I said is
on the content model level so it's not
just one big prompt to generate a full
blog post it's a series of prompts that
stack on top of each other to uh
generate all the aspects of the blog
post and then after we got got all the
the prompts uh figured out we run them
against the index to make sure we're
generate the we're generating the
content that we expect and then there's
a stage after that which is maintenance
because especially if you're using a
publicly available large language model
there's a a concept called prompt drift
where as they update the model your
prompt doesn't act the way that it did
before and so you just want to make sure
you're on top of that so that you
continue to get the outputs that expect
